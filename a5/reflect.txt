Upon completion of this course, I was able to enhance my knowledge and skills in programming. I was able to enhance my coding skills by using the concepts of constructors and destructors. I also learned various functions and their utilization in programs. I was able to use the principles of encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and templates in my programming language and hence I was able to utilize it in my workshops and projects and hence I was able to improve and enhance my programming skills and abilities. By doing the workshop and milestones I was able to improve my programming ability and I was also able to manage time management. By doing the quizzes, I was able to improve my knowledge and skill in the programming language. The midterm exam was challenging and time consuming and hence I was not able to score very well. Overall, the course helped me to understand, and it has helped me a lot in a professional manner. As a suggestion from me, I would request the college to change the online sessions to in persons session as we will be able to learn more from the professors by learning in-person.
