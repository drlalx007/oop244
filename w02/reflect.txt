I have learned about function overloading and the usage of references and pointers this week course. The workshop was quite interesting as it enabled me to drive more into functions, references, and pointers. The most difficult part of the program was the fixing of the load() function and the display() function to give the correct outputs as there were some initial errors in the loop. Moreover, in this week, I had learned about static & dynamic memory and many other keywords & Memory leak.
The out-parameter refers to the data that is passed from the function, back to its caller. This function works by storing the value into the other parameter. Use call by reference or call by pointer for an out-parameter. 
The in-parameter is data that is being passed from the function caller to the function. For small things, such as integers or real numbers, you usually use call by value for an in-parameter. The load() function is an example of the in-parameter.
