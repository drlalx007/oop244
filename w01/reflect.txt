Both the first and second part of the workshop help me to implement modular programming in this workshop. The first part helped me to learn more about breaking down the program into smaller modules, thus simplifying it. The use of namespace was quite confusing for me as it was pretty much a new topic for me even though I have a touch with the C++ programming language. The second part of the workshop was a bit more complex and required more time than the first workshop in getting the logic as I had to create the C-Library. The most challenging part of the workshop was understanding what to do for the strStr() function which was the toughest among the CString functions, but I overcame the challenge by using while-loops, for loop, and a couple of if-statement. Finally, the workshop has helped me to work with header file and it has helped me to learn more about modular programming and implement it in this workshop.
