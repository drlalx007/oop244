Overall, this workshop has helped me enhance my skills in programming. I now know that a pure function is a function that return values are identical for identical arguments and that the function application has no side effects. I also understood the concept of abstract base and the utilization of one in my program. I also can now implement the behaviour using the virtual functions. I also understood that a derived class that can implement all its missing functionality is known as a concrete class and that an abstract class is a base class from which other classes are derived and hence, I am now able to differentiate the difference between an abstract class and a concreate class. Overall, this program helped me understood and enchase my skill and knowledge about programming and it has helped me to expand my knowledge in constructors and destructors.
