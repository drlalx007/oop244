Upon successful completion of this workshop, I now can create a binary member operator which is an operator which consist of one or more operands. I also learned and was able to implement the type conversion operator, a unary operator and was also able to create a helper binary operator between classes and was also able to create a helper operator between a primitive and a class.
I was also able to implement more about constructors and I was able to widen my knowledge on the use and implementation of constructures and destructors. I also learned to work with a primitive member function and a class thus enhancing my knowledge on classes and primitive types. I was also able to implement the concept of overloading and hence I was able to expand my knowledge on them.
