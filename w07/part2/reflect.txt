Overall, from this week I was able to learn lot from the workshops and the milestones as it has helped me to enhance my ability and skill in the C++ programming language. I am now able to fully understand as to how to derive classes and functions and I know how to utilize them in my programs. I was also able to learn different kinds of relationships and how it is relates with the class. I also understood the concept of shadowing and its implementation in the programs. I also know the inheritance hierarchy of constructors & destructors and the order in which they execute, and I have also been able to know that granting protected access to any data member exposes that member to potential corruption and hence it is considered as a poor program design. Hence, a protected read-only query is a preferable alternative to protected access to a data member in a class.  All these concepts that I have learned so far have helped me enhance and improve my programming ability.
